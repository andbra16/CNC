1) What problem are they trying to solve? How does the problem manifest itself?

Facebook uses the scripting language PHP. Scripting languages create high 
programming productivity with their rich set of libraries and their dynamic 
typing. However, scripting languages take much more CPU time to run than 
compiled languages. Because Facebook deals with a large scale of users and data,improving server efficiency is a key factor in reducing their operating costs.

2) What is their proposal?

Their proposal was to implement a static compiler for PHP called the HipHop compiler. Compiled languages are much faster than interpreted languages, and if they could create a static compiler for PHP they could increase its performance.

3) How will the proposal solve the problem

The proposal will solve the problem by compiling PHP code into static C++ code.
Once the PHP code is compiled into the C++ code, it will have been fully optimized and run much faster than the old PHP code. The compile process was broken down into 6 steps. 

1. Parsing - generates AST
2. Program analysis - collects symbols and their dependencies
3. Pre-optimizer - performs type-independent optimizations
4. Type inference - infers primitive types of expressions
5. Post-optimizer - performs type-dependent optimizations
6. Code generation - outputs C++ code

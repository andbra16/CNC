1) Summarize the goals of Erlang

The goals of Erlang are:

1) Handle a very large number of concurrent activities
2) Perform actions at a certain point in time or within a certain time
3) Be easily distributable over a network of computers
4) Be fault-tolerant to both software & hardware errors
5) Stay in continuous operation for many years
6) Scale with the number of machines on the network
7) Be upgradable & reconfigurable without having to stop & restart

2) What does it say about software design.

Software design is a matter of programming. Some systems accept specifications and then generate code. Others use an approach of raising the level of programming by using a language technology at a high abstraction level which provides built-in support required by the application domain.

3) What is interoperability? Why is it important?

Interoperability is the ability of making systems work together. It is important because the ability to exchange data and communicate between multiple systems is crucial in software development.

4) What is a lightweight process and why is it important?

A light-weight process is a means of achieving multitasking. It is important because it can provide some major performance benefits.

5) What is the role of a virtual machine?

The role of a virtual machine is to make the programming language independent of the operating system and ensuring program portability.

6) Why do they justify or need dynamic typing?

They wanted Erlang to be a symbolic language.

7) What is the actor model?

The actor model is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received.

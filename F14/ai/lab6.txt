I started off trying to implement local search with the java code that you provided. It took me a while to see how countCols worked with the Queens being tied to the row. So, I then moved on to trying to implement countDiagonals. I had a hard time doing this so I scratched the idea.

I figured that I could understand the problem better if I started from the ground up. So, I started implementing my own Queens board setup. I used a depth first search approach. My board would try and place the queen in the first available spot in a row. For each row that the Queen was placed, a check method would be used to see if the Queen that was about to be placed conflicted with any other queen on the board. If it conflicted, it would place it in the next available spot.
